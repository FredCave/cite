Dissolve. Part I. She descends into the water and becomes the sea.\
\
And never again drank he.\
\
The surface was lost in a glow which seemed the only truly real thing.\
\
Come down, she hears.\
\
The call out loud rolls to the shore.\
\
It comes back as an echo.\
\
The picture dissolves, then rearranges itself.\
\
Narcissus saw the image of the ungraspable phantom of life.\
\
The same we see in all rivers and oceans.\
\
Come, they say.\
\
That is all.\
\
She slipped among the moving currents, which quickly immersed her.\
\
She slides down as quietly as a shadow can glide into deep water. \
\
No ripples. \
\
A little agitation in the mirror, that is all.\
\
The pearls shine above her head and shoot small dots of light down through her path.\
\
A sort of revery in which she confused herself with the sea.\
\
Shapeless, formless, like water.\
\
Be water, my friend.\
\
The ideal sea which she was becoming ever more intimately had become the real sea, in which she was virtually drowned.\
\
For God separated the Waters from the Waters.\
The true and Internal Sea from this External and Navigable Sea, he disjoyned on the first dayes.\
Probably the most important feature of a biomembrane is that it is a selectively permeable structure . . . [which is] essential for effective separation. \
\
In an evolutionary sense, living bodies are necessary for the proliferation of what scientists Mark and Dianna McMenamin call Hypersea, which arose when life moved out of marine waters and by necessity folded a watery habitat \'93back inside of itself.\'94 \
A body needing water, and water needing a body.\
\
Once more they have found themselves, in themselves.\
\
The sun rose above the waves, and the warm rays fell on the cold foam of her former body.\
\
Remember Aphrodite, born of foam.\
\
Tides create as they destroy with an insistent action that traces itself, a beginning again and again. \
\
They tell the same story over and over.\
\
Smashing beginnings and endings together in the surf. \
\
(body becoming fractalized vector \'96 infinitely scalable)\
\
(Foam \'96> Meerschaum)\
\
Bodies of water. \
\
Sixty-five percent.\
\
Aqueous solutions mediate our metabolic reactions.\
\
(She sinks as sediment down to the bottom of the ocean.)\
\
Her water-filled cells crystalize, the membranes shatter and solidify as shards.\
\
Somewhere at the bottom of the sea, there must be water that sank from the surface during the \'91Little Ice Age\'92 three centuries ago . . . \
The ocean remembers. \
Just as the deep oceans harbor particulate records of former geological eras, water retains our more anthropomorphic secrets, even when we would rather forget. Our distant and more immediate pasts are returned to us in both trickles and floods. \
\
All that is human is taken from earth and to earth shall return.\
\
Ashes to ashes.\
Dust to dust.\
\
Nature has a never much completely extinguished, rightful claim to this work, however much it may be formed by the spirit.\'94\
\
The ruin reverses the human-centred order: what was raised by the spirit becomes the object of the same forces which form the contour of the mountain and the bank of the river.\
\
She sank down to outlast all that she knew.\
\
Become part of the secret interiors of the earth. \
\
Becoming lithic, the storied matter of the ground.\
\
A calmer trauma, fossilised.\
\
On and on and on.\
\
Joy, rocks off.\
\
Rocks down here.\
\
Lithic bones become mineral once more.\
\
The cemetery floor thickens with what once was, and what will be again.\
\
Stories inscribed in stone.\
\
A deep time love story, wait another eon for it to play out.\
\
To the human eye \'96 stony silence, stony secrets.\
\
This resting place transports narratives through inhuman timeframes.\
\
Do the math.\
Mountains surge and fall, their epochal undulations no less animated than the swell and crash of seas. \
sweeping romances of scale, time, memorialization, creation, cataclysm, a relentless tectonicity.\
The pearls in the water float up to the light.\
Pearls, the melding of the creaturely and the mineral \'96 the ideal materialization of the soul.\
Lithic histories are ongoing \'96 everything is eroded \'96 everything is remade.}
